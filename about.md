My name is Daniel Lowengrub. Currently Iâ€™m working as a software engineer at Apple.
Before joining Apple I worked at the autonomous vehicle startup Drive.ai.

Prior to working in the software industry I was a mathematics graduate student at UC Berkeley.
You can see some of my academic work [here](https://math.berkeley.edu/~lowdanie/).

In this blog I try to summarize interesting pieces of mathematics which have applications to computer science and physics.
